The Subterranean Access Point Surveillance System (SAPSS) is a comprehensive solution designed for monitoring, cleaning, managing manholes in urban sewer systems. 
Abstract: The Subterranean Access Point Surveillance System
(SAPSS) is a comprehensive solution designed for monitoring
and managing manholes in urban sewer systems. SAPSS
integrates advanced technologies, including sensors,
microcontrollers, and communication modules, to provide realtime data on water levels, gas emissions, vibrations, and debris
accumulation. By detecting abnormalities early, SAPSS enables
proactive maintenance, minimizing the risk of costly damages
and ensuring the integrity of sewer systems. The system consists
of an ESP32 microcontroller, waterproof ultrasonic sensor, MQ2
gas sensor, tilt sensor, GSM module, boost module, mesh frame
with a servo motor, and ThingSpeak integration for real-time
data monitoring and analysis. The ESP32 serves as the central
processing unit, interfacing with the various sensors and modules
to collect and process data. The GSM module enables SAPSS to
send real-time alerts to maintenance personnel, ensuring prompt
action in case of abnormalities. Implementation of SAPSS
involves programming the ESP32 microcontroller using the
Arduino IDE and integrating the sensors and modules for data
collection. The system is highly scalable, allowing for additional
sensors and modules to be added for more comprehensive
monitoring. The feasibility of SAPSS is supported by the
availability of off-the-shelf components and the relatively
straightforward integration process. Overall, SAPSS offers a
comprehensive and innovative solution for monitoring and
managing manholes in urban sewer systems, enabling proactive
maintenance and ensuring the sustainability of urban
infrastructure.

I. INTRODUCTION
Urbanization is rapidly transforming the landscape of
cities worldwide, leading to increased demand for efficient
and sustainable infrastructure. Among the critical
components of urban infrastructure are sewer systems, which
play a crucial role in managing wastewater and preventing
environmental pollution. Manholes, serving as access points
to these systems, are essential for maintenance and
inspection but often face challenges such as blockages,
flooding, and structural issues.
Traditional monitoring methods for manholes are
manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors, making it
challenging to detect issues before they escalate. To address
these challenges, we propose the Subterranean Access Point
Surveillance System (SAPSS), an innovative solution that
integrates a range of sensors and communication modules
with an ESP32 microcontroller. This system provides realtime data on water levels, gas emissions, vibrations, and
debris accumulation, enabling proactive maintenance and
minimizing the risk of costly damages.
One of the key features of SAPSS is its integration with
ThingSpeak, an IoT platform that enables the collection,
analysis, and visualization of sensor data in real-time. By
leveraging ThingSpeak, SAPSS provides maintenance
personnel and engineers with actionable insights to optimize
infrastructure management and address potential issues
promptly.
In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and
feasibility of SAPSS. We discuss the system architecture,
including the ESP32 microcontroller, sensors, and
communication modules. We also describe the integration
process and the scalability of the system, highlighting its
potential for future expansion. Additionally, we discuss the
environmental benefits of SAPSS, including reduced
flooding, pollution prevention, and enhanced safety.
Overall, SAPSS offers a comprehensive and innovative
solution for monitoring and managing manholes in urban
sewer systems. By leveraging advanced technologies and
real-time data analysis, SAPSS enables proactive
maintenance, minimizing environmental impact, and
ensuring the sustainability of urban infrastructure.
